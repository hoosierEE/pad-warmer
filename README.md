Pad Warmer
==========
This device consists of the following components

* MyPin Temperature Controller (TA4-SNR+K)
* solid state relay
* heating pad
* stainless steel sheet and K-type temperature sensor

Usage
-----
1. plug in heating pad to MedAssociates DIG-725
2. connect corresponding "operate input" to the pad warmer's operate cable
3. place stainless steel sheet atop the heating pad and ensure the sensor is not loose in the aluminum heat spreader block
4. plug in all IEC power cables
5. turn the pad warmer on and wait 15 minutes for the pad to come up to a stable temperature

> IMPORTANT NOTE
> during the warm-up period the pad will become significantly hotter than the set temperature, so it is important to wait for it to stabilize.
Configuration
-------------
Currently the pad is set to maintain a temperature of 30 degrees C.

Adjustments
-----------
Consult the user manual for making adjustments to the target temperature and ramp up/down parameters.

Wiring
------
The TA4-SNR+K model is wired to accept a K-type temperature sensor, with the negative attached to pin 7 and the positive to pin 8.

A MedAssociates DIG-725 switch is used for its solid-state relay, connected to the TA4 at pins 3 (positive) and 4 (negative).

AC power enters the enclosure through an IEC socket, passes through a 0.5A fuse, an on-off switch, and finally terminates at the TA4 on pins 1 and 2.

Maintenance
-----------
Replace fuse with 0.5A or smaller.
